# Initial Setup Steps for Azure DevOps Lab with .NET Core, Docker and VSTS

These are more detailed steps for the setup tasks with screenshots

## 1. Creating a new VSTS account / project
 * Choose a unique name for your account, make sure you choose git to manage your code:

 * If you just created a new VSTS account, it will automatically create a project called "MyFirstProject" 
so you can use that


## 2. Create a custom VSTS agent pool & queue
 * In VSTS, click the settings cog and go into 'Agent queues'.

 * Create a new token, the name doesn't matter, and leave scope as "All".  
 Once the token is created will get one chance to copy it, so paste it somewhere safe
